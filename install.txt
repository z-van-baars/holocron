Installation Instructions:
_______________________________________________________________________________

1.  Visit https://oilfurnace.slack.com/apps/new/A0F7YS25R-bots and set up a new
	bot profile.  The name can be whatever, as long as it's unique to previously
	chosen bot names.  Make it memorable if you want.  Copy the name from the 
	box on the slack page and paste it on line 1 (line 0 in python speak) of 
	config.txt.  Then go back to the page and hit "Add Bot Integration"

2.  Copy the API token from the next page, and place this on line 3 (line 2 in 
	python speak) of config.txt and save and close it.

3.  Choose a unique icon for your bot if you want.  Doesn't really matter, but 
	helps to distinguish between bots I guess.  Then scroll down to
	"Save Integration"

4.  Next, run print_bot_id.py from the command line.  It will pull the API token
	and the bot name from config.txt and return a bot UID.  Copy the UID from 
	the command line and paste it on line 2 (line 1 in python speak) of
	config.txt.

5.  Before closing config.txt, make sure that line 6 (line 5 in python) matches
	the path to your copy of "NiceHash Miner 2.exe".  By default, this is 
	C:/Program Files/NiceHash Miner 2/NiceHash Miner 2.exe, and that's what is
	in the default config.txt file.

7.  Go to the rig_monitor channel on Slack, and invite your new bot user.

6.  Run holocron_slack.py from the command line.  If everything is set up right,
	it should start printing out to the command line.  Look for the line 
	"holocron established connection with slack", and then go to the rig_monitor
	channel and wait for the checkin message from the bot.
